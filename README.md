# Portfolio
Hi there! My name is Nolan Kovacik, and this is my project portfolio.
I consider myself a Frontend Engineer, although I dabble in Backend Systems, and Data Science as well.

> ## React Boilerplate
> This project was set up using `npx create-react-app ./ --typescript`, so it came with some boilerplate commands and code.
> For more information about this, be sure to checkout the auto-generated [react readme](./REACT.md).

## Technologies Used
This portfolio is meant to showcase my aptitudes in *multiple* dimensions.
The repository itself was carefully made to practice many conventions, opinions, and parameters.
Thus, some really cool technologies have been used!
- Command Line
- VSCode
- React
- TypeScript
- Jest
- GitHub Pages
- Travis CI
- Coveralls
- Git Kraken
- Sass
- ESLinter
- Prettier
- CSS Frameworks
- Uglify JS
- Uglify CSS

# Local Setup
1. fork or clone this repository.
1. run `yarn`.
1. run `yarn start`.

# Deployment
1. create a pull request to `dev`.
1. when operations are ready, `dev` will be merged to `deploy`.
1. while on `deploy`, a programmer can run `yarn run deploy` to trigger a build.
	- note: the deployment will only take effect if there are changes to the frontend.
1. `master` is an orphaned branch; github uses this branch as information to host on github pages.
