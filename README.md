# Portfolio
Hi there! My name is Nolan Kovacik, and this is my project portfolio.
I consider myself a Frontend Engineer, although I dabble in Backend Systems, and Data Science as well.

> ## React Boilerplate
> This project was set up using `npx create-react-app ./ --typescript`, so it came with some boilerplate commands and code.
> For more information about this, be sure to checkout the auto-generated [react readme](./REACT.md).
